# wearos_cgms
Wear OS CGMS.  Direct connect from a moto 360 to a bluetooth cgms device.  Works with code from CC2500-Project, you could also get the feather cgms to work with some effort.
Provides a basic watchface that displays BG readings, and also provides the data as a complication so you can view it from some of the fancier watchfaces.
